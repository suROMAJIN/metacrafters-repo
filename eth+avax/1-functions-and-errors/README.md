# Functions and Errors
## Overview

FunctionsExamples is a simple token contract built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed primarily for educational purposes. 
This contract showcases how to enforce ownership rules in a decentralized application, allowing only the designated owner to execute certain functions. 
The contract is designed for educational purposes, illustrating best practices in Solidity programming.

## Features
    Ownership Management: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute specific functions.
    Error Handling: Demonstrates various methods of error handling in Solidity, including require(), revert(), and assert().

## Functions
function onlyOwner() public view

    Description: Checks if the caller is the owner of the contract. This method ensures that only the owner can call functions that require ownership. 
    If a non-owner attempts to call this function, it will revert with an error message.
    Parameters: None
    Returns: None

function isOwnerHere() public view

    Description: Verifies if the caller is the owner of the contract. This method checks if the caller's address matches the owner's address. If it does not, it reverts the transaction with a specific error message.
    Parameters: None
    Returns: None

function assertOwner() public view

    Description: Asserts that the caller is the owner of the contract. This method uses assert to guarantee that only the owner can call this function. If a non-owner attempts to call it, an assertion failure will occur, indicating a critical logic error.
    Parameters: None
    Returns: None
